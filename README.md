# We-against-cyber-crime
WACc (prononuced - Waaa-k)(here in reffered to 'the program') is an AI program aimed at educating people to take action against any form of Cyber-Crime and Cyberbullying.
The program works by analyzing any user provided content or by pointing to any content such as emails, text scripts, Pictures. 

the program suggests the user if the content comes under any law such as _"Hacking and Data theft under section 43 and 66 of IT Act", "Offensive messages under section 66A"._
The program then suggests where and how this can be reported, giving them easier access to such actions and better chance of reporting.
Futhermore the program can be expanded to a much greater extant to help fight cyber crime.
while the program seems like it tell you if something is illegal or legal, it is not that. WACc DO NOT states if something is right or wrong, it suggests if it is in the law or if there's a possibility that it is related to any such law, REMEMBER ALWAYS TO GET HELP. THIS PROGRAM IS NOT A LEGAL ADVISOR. IF SOMETHING FEELS WRONG OR HARM YOU IN ANY WAY, REPORT concerned Authorities.

WACc is the bigger picture which should be implemented and expanded in smaller steps, another such step is Recognizing texting pattern to see the probability that the text might have been by a person. by analyzing the person's older text scripts.
